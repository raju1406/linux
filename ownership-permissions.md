### Permissions and Ownership

We have 3 types of ownership.

**User:** He is the one created the file/folder. Denotes by u <br/>
**Group:** a group of users the file belongs to. Denotes by g <br/>
**Other:** Any one other than the user and group. Denotes by o <br/>

3 types of Permissions

**Read:** denotes by number 4 <br/>
**Write:** Denotes by number 2 <br/> 
**Execute:** Denotes by number 1 <br/>
```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user  1483 May 24 13:58 eks-client.sh
```
Above line has total 10 characters. First character  shows it is file(-) <br/>
Next 3 characters denotes permission of user. <br/>
Next 3 characters denotes permission of group <br/>
Next 3 characters denotes permission of other <br/>

So user has read and write access. <br/>
Group has read and write access. <br/>
others have only write access. <br/>

If we want to add execute permission to everyone.

```
chmod ugo+x [file-name]
```

If we want to add write permission only to user and group.

```
chmod ug+w [file-name]
```

If we want to remove execute access to all.

```
chmod ugo-x [file-name]
```

We can use letters also.
R+W = 4+2 =6
R+W+X = 4+2+1 = 7

Below line denotes read access to user and no access to group and others.
```
chmod 400 [file-name]
```
